# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Lena Sƒôdkiewicz  

**üîê Application Security Specialist | üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Professional | üíª Fullstack Developer**  

I focus on **application security**, helping to build and maintain resilient software through **secure coding, code reviews, vulnerability testing, and hardening practices**.  
My strength lies in combining hands-on **fullstack development experience** with **security expertise**, allowing me to identify vulnerabilities at both the **design** and **implementation** stages.  

I‚Äôm also deeply interested in **social engineering**, having contributed to a Seukrak Publishing House publication on this topic.  
My background in **psychology** provides an additional perspective on **human factors in cybersecurity**.

## üëÄ Interests  
‚ú® I‚Äôm passionate about **secure development** ‚Äî seeing security not as an afterthought, but as an integral part of the development lifecycle. For me, writing and testing secure code is one of the most important skills for the future of software engineering.  

üß† I also apply my **psychological knowledge** to educate others about **digital hygiene**.  
From a security standpoint, this is critical: when we are overwhelmed with information, always available for conversations, and lack time to detach from work issues, we become more vulnerable to **social engineering attacks**.  
At the same time, developers under such pressure are more likely to take **shortcuts in the programming process**, which can lower security levels.  

‚û°Ô∏è By addressing both the **technical** and **human** aspects of security, I aim to promote a **holistic approach** to protecting applications and users.
