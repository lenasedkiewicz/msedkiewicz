# 👋 Hi, I’m Lena Sędkiewicz

**Application Security Specialist, Cybersecurity Professional, Fullstack Developer**  

I focus on **application security**, helping to build and maintain resilient software through **secure coding, code reviews, vulnerability testing, and hardening practices**. My strength lies in combining hands-on **fullstack development experience** with **security expertise**, allowing me to identify vulnerabilities at both the design and implementation stages.

I’m also deeply interested in **social engineering**, having contributed to a Seukrak Publishing House publication on this topic. My background in **psychology** provides an additional perspective on human factors in cybersecurity.

## 👀 Interests  
I’m passionate about **secure development** — seeing security not as an afterthought, but as an integral part of the development lifecycle. For me, writing and testing secure code is one of the most important skills for the future of software engineering.  

I also apply my **psychological knowledge** to educate others about **digital hygiene**. From a security standpoint, this is critical: when we are constantly overwhelmed with information, always available for conversations, and lack space to detach from work issues, we become more vulnerable to **social engineering attacks**. At the same time, developers under such pressure are more likely to take **shortcuts in the programming process**, which can lower security levels. By addressing both the **technical** and **human** aspects of security, I aim to promote a holistic approach to protecting applications and users.

## 🌱 Skills & Technologies  
My technical stack combines **development expertise** and **security tools**:  

- **Frontend & UI**: React, JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, Redux  
- **Backend & APIs**: Node.js, Python  
- **Testing & QA**: Jest, Postman  
- **DevOps & Containers**: Docker  
- **Styling & Accessibility**: TailwindCSS, Material UI, technical SEO, accessibility best practices  
- **Internationalisation**: i18n  

**Security Tools & Practices**  
- ZAP (dynamic application security testing)  
- Kali Linux (penetration testing & security toolkit)  
- Semgrep (static analysis & secure code scanning)  
- Secure coding practices, threat modeling, code review for vulnerabilities  

This developer background enables me to understand **application architectures** deeply and apply **security best practices** (OWASP, threat modeling, secure SDLC) throughout the stack.
